# DataStructure

## implement data structure using c.

## notes:

in LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Array, Vector, i use c propercessor implement generic data structure,
  and the others will implement dynamic typing using void* or void**.


The data structure will be suspended for a period of time, because the basic data 
structure framework has been formed, and most of the subsequent data structures 
are related to complex algorithms. After understanding and mastering the 
complex algorithms based on data structures, go back and build the remaining data structures.
